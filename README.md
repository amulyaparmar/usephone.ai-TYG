# ✨usePhone.AI:     Your Open-Source AI Phone, Voice, & Evaluator for your Organization 
<!--
, AI Trainer & Roleplays & Transcripts + Evaluations  for your company TYG ✨

Today, there is a crisis in America. A huge churn in Frontline Operations. Inefficient training, poor performance management. I have worked with property managers for the past 4-5 years and noticed this first hand. 

[usePhone.ai](https://usePhone.ai)-TYG is a powerful platform designed to enable ANYBODY and ANY COMPANY to build, test, and deploy their own Voice AI tools to train, onboard, and continuously evaluate the frontline operations. 

There is LLM evaluation for our models, but what about these evaluations for front office work (That is why we open sourced [AI Mystery Shops for Phone calls](https://usePhone.ai/call) (Powered by Deepgram and Twilio + Vapi)? Does it make also just to deploy these 'LLM's of humans before some training? [AI Roleplays with custom Curriculum](https://usePhone.ai/train) and taking the time to evaluate a call without a rubric can lead to inconsistent testing (testing people is often such), and ultimately every business has their own AI evaluators as example  [here](https://usePhone.ai/eval?callSid=CAda556251a63586c3cbd01958dc2aa21a).

Ultimately, It provides comprehensive features to enhance customer interactions and improve team performance.
